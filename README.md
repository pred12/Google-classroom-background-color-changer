#### Instructions!

##### First,
Go to google classroom,
right click and go to inspect element,
they navagate to the "**console tab**" Right by "**Element**," click on "**console**."

##### Then,
Go to the file [Main.js](main.js), open it their are instructions on at the top.
Copy all of it,
then past it in the console,
**Hit enter/return**

Your done!
If you have any issues or you need me to explane it some more, please email me at (123097@usd230.org) Name the subject "Background-Color:Error" or go to [here](https://github.com/pred12/Google-classroom-background-color-changer/issues) and make a new issue

--------------------------------------------------

#### IMPORTANT!
If you refresh the page, it will not change colors!

----------------------------------------------------

#### Extras,
I would recommend pining the tab,
If you don't know how to do that, **right click** on the tab press **pin**

If you want to just change the background color to one color, just go to the console and put this, 
```javascript
document.querySelector("body").style.backgroundColor = "coloryouwant"; 
```
**MUST BE A CSS COLOR!** (Google it if you don't know what it is)
[or just go click on this](http://www.colors.commutercreative.com/grid/)

---------------------------------------------------

#### Questions

"Can I put a image?",

yes you can but it is really hard to get the image throught inspect element or through file path (file path ant really work)
I have tried and still am so maybe one day!



"I get an error that says 'color is aready defined' (or somthing like that)",

That mean you have aready copy pasted the code, (or the color varable) two thing to do,
  * refresh the page and past all the code again (with the color varable)
  * Delete the color varable out before you push enter 
  
Please don't email me or make a new issue saying,


1: "Some thing don't get changed", 


2: "Some things get changes that should not be",


3: "I want X colored or not colored",

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1: Some things that should be changed are not, I am working on a way to get that to change.


2: ^^


3: Sorry unless you email me and I have the time, I can't help you I am willing to do it but I have a life so, I will get to it when I can!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Feel free to shair this with anyone!
Just don't say clam it as your own
