## Instructions!
##### First,
Go to google classroom,
right click and go to inspect element,
they navagate to the "**console tab**" Right by "**Element**," click on "**console**."

##### Then,
Go to the file [Main.js](main.js), open it their are instructions on at the top.
Copy all of it,
then past it in the console,
**Hit enter/return**

Your done!
If you have any issues or you need me to explane it some more, please email me at (123097@usd230.org) Name the subject "Background-Color:Error" or go to [here](https://github.com/pred12/Google-classroom-background-color-changer/issues) and make a new issue


### IMPORTANT!
If you refresh the page, it will not change colors!

##### Extras,
I would recommend pining the tab,
If you don't know how to do that, **right click** on the tab press **pin**

If you want to just change the background color to one color, just go to the console and put this, 
```javascript
document.querySelector("body").style.backgroundColor = "coloryouwant"; 
```
**MUST BE A CSS COLOR!** (Google it if you don't know what it is)


Feel free to shair this with anyone!
Just don't say clam it as your own
